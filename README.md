# aMAZEing
This repo is a small project in python to generate and solve mazes with unique solutions

#how to use:
1) open main.py
2) set the size of the maze (rows and cols should be int) on the config parameters
3) run it and you should get a brand new maze!

#the next steps for this project would be:
1) build a website or more interactive way to generate the maze
2) generate solutions for the generated mazes
3) set root as SE point to increase complexity of the maze
3) explore other algorithms to generate mazes with other layouts


#If you would like to help, I would love suggestions on how to improve:
    maybe I should organize the code differently?
    maybe I should write the code differently?
    maybe I've got some mistakes or I am ignoring best practices?
    maybe you have a suggestion on what I should do next?
