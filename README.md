# aMAZEing
This repo is a small project in python to generate and solve mazes with unique solutions

#how to use:
1) open main.py
2) set the size of the maze (rows and cols should be int) on the config parameters
3) run it and you should get a brand new maze!

#the next steps for this project would be:
1) develop some unit testing to make sure things don't break
2) conform to pep8
3) build a website or more interactive way to generate the maze
4) generate solutions for the generated mazes
5) explore other algorithms to generate mazes with other layouts

#please note that I am NOT looking for code, If you would like to help, I would love suggestions on how to improve:
    maybe i should organize the code diffrently?
    maybe i should write the code diffrently?
    maybe i've got some mistakes or I am ignoring best practices?
    maybe I'm missing a key next step?
    I just need to know what direction to walk, but I'd love to keep on doing the walking
